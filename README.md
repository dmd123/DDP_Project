Course Project: Shiny Application and Reproducible Pitch<br>
•	It is especially important to submit this assignment before the deadline, April 10, 11:59 PM PDT<br>
•	This peer assessed assignment has two parts:<br>
1.	Create a Shiny application and deploy it on Rstudio's servers.<br>
2.	Use Slidify or Rstudio Presenter to prepare a reproducible pitch presentation about your application.<br>
<br>
Part 1 – Shiny Application<br>
•	Write a shiny application with associated supporting documentation. The documentation should be thought of as whatever a user will need to get started using your application.<br>
•	Deploy the application on Rstudio's shiny server<br>
•	Share the application link by pasting it into the provided text box<br>
•	Share your server.R and ui.R code on github<br>
•	The application must include the following:<br>
o	Some form of input (widget: textbox, radio button, checkbox, ...)<br>
o	Some operation on the ui input in sever.R<br>
o	Some reactive output displayed as a result of server calculations<br>
o	Enough documentation so that a novice user could use your application<br>
o	Documentation should be at the Shiny website itself. Do not post to an external link.<br>
o	The Shiny application in question is entirely up to you. However, if you're having trouble coming up with ideas, you could start from the simple prediction algorithm done in class and build a new algorithm on one of the R datasets packages. Please make the package simple for the end user, so that they don't need a lot of your prerequisite knowledge to evaluate your application. You should emphasize a simple project given the short time frame.<br>
<br>
Part 2 –Reproducible Pitch Presentation<br>
OK, you've made your shiny app, now it's time to make your pitch. You get 5 slides (inclusive of the title slide) to pitch your app. You're going to create a web page using Slidify or Rstudio Presenter with an html5 slide deck.<br>
•	5 slides to pitch our idea done in Slidify or Rstudio Presenter<br>
•	Your presentation pushed to github or Rpubs<br>
•	A link to your github or Rpubs presentation pasted into the provided text box<br>
•	Your presentation must satisfy the following:<br>
•	Done in Slidify or Rstudio Presenter<br>
•	5 pages<br>
•	Hosted on github or Rpubs<br>
•	Contain some embedded R code that gets run when slidifying the document<br>
•	Notice to publish your slidify presentation to github or Rpubs, there's the publish command. This link outlines how to do it (it's one line) http://slidify.org/publish.html<br>
•	Rstudio presenter has a button to publish directly to Rpubs https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/200714023-Displaying-and-Distributing-Presentations. If you are using Rpubs, put in the link to the presentation into the submission box as a http:// link not a https:// link.<br>
•	You can also publish using both formats to github manually using gh-pages, though your github branch must have a .nojekyll fle and be on a branch names gh-pages. There's more on gh-pages here https://pages.github.com/ and there is a video lecture outlining how to do this.<br>
